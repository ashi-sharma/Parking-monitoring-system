# Parking-monitoring-system


WHY THIS?
To reduce manual work and avoid roaming of cars in the parking lot to find empty space.

WORKING: 
The basic idea is to monitor how many parking slots are available at the current moment and exactly which slot is empty to park a car in shopping  malls and other big places such as hospitals,etc. A screen will be showing the status outside the parking lot. 
This system can be achieved in three ways:
RFID:
In this system instead of issuing a parking ticket to the driver you just give a RFID system which notes down the entry and exit time.
Also useful to calculate parking charges.
In the rfid system there are two options:
Using a rfid card which is given to the customer in hand which is supposed to be left in the car by the customer so as to track where the car is parked.
A RFID tag/magnet can be sticked to the car which then can be removed when the car exits the parking lot.

Image Processing using ML model:
Using a certain orientation of cameras, each of the parking slot’s images can be traced and processed.
(Brief explanation of the given image)
Each slot will have a sign board/magnet   showing an empty sign  that will be captured by camera and recognized by the ML model and hence no. of slots empty will be calculated and displayed on the screen. When a car is parked the mark will not be visible hence the slot is not available. 
CCTV cameras will also serve for safety purpose.
 
Sensor(Proximity Sensor):
 In the sensor system we would have to install a sensor in every parking slot which would detect whether a car is parked on that slot or not.
This sensor when returns information back to the server which then displays the number of parking slots left and which all are empty.
Here in this system either there has to be a battery with the sensor so as to use it wirelessly but if we have to use wired connection then we would have to drill a lot inside a parking lot so as to install this system which will cost a lot of extra money.
